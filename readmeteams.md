Teams is a version of alfred which creates easy to use q/a style forum for networks

Structure:

	Teams have multiple users (and users have posts [read more below *])
	Users have one Team

	* Users have multiple posts
	  Posts have one user



	Couldn't figure out comments yet, so it's more of a synchronous chatbot for teams right now. A little buggy but a start.
